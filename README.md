# Tau-analysis
This repository contains code for the whole-brain-scale analysis of pTau depositions, utilizing datasets imaged through tissue clearing and light-sheet microscopy.




## Overview
The primary objective of this code is to facilitate the identification and analysis of pTau protein deposition patterns across the entire brain. Our methods integrate several advanced computational techniques and visualization tools to achieve this goal.




## Basic Workflow
The basic procedure for analyzing whole-brain tau depositions consists of the following steps:

1. Expert Review: Initially, raw data undergo a thorough review by experts to exclude any non-specifically stained anatomical regions.
2. Voxel Scale Normalization: Data are normalized to a resolution of 8.3x8.3x8.3 Âµm to ensure uniformity across different datasets.
3. Tau Deposition ROI Extraction: Regions of interest (ROIs) for tau deposition are identified using a Gaussian-mean difference method. This is implemented in the **Tau extraction.ipynb** notebook.
4. CUBIC-Cloud Registration: Following ROI extraction, data are registered to a mouse brain atlas using CUBIC-Cloud (https://cubic-cloud.com/), a software tool designed for whole-brain visualization and analysis. The guidelines were detailed in Mano T et al., CellRepMethods, 2021 ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crmeth.2021.100038)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crmeth.2021.100038).





## Advanced Analysis
Further analysis is conducted through the following advanced procedures:

1. Tau Gradient Consensus Analysis: Detailed workflow for consensus analysis on tau gradients, structured in **Tau gradient consensus analysis.ipynb**.
2. Whole Brain Data Visualization: Comprehensive tools and methods for visualizing the whole brain pTau depositions data, structured in **Tau gradient consensus analysis.ipynb**.





## Summary of results
1. Summary of Regional pTau Depositions: Refer to Supplementary Table 1, "**Supplementary Table 1. Regional tau profile data with each anatomical annotation.xlsx**" for a detailed breakdown.
2. Source pTau Distribution Data for Three Samples: See Supplementary Table 2, "**Supplementary Table 2. Source data for single-deposition-level tau profiles from three 18-month-old Rosa26-KI Tau++tTA+ mice**" for specific data.

Note: This code does not currently include source image data from light-sheet imaging.





## System Requirements
This code has been tested on a CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 (Core) PC within a Python 3.6.8 virtualenv environment.
